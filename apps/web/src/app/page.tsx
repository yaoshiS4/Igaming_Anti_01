/* ============================================================================
 * Yaobet — HOME / LOBBY (route "/") — SPEC-03 §home, SPEC-04 Wave 5.
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * A Server Component: it fetches every dynamic surface server-side as typed §F
 * envelopes (jackpot, member-day, leaderboard, live-match, vip-progress,
 * balance) and the static fixtures (verticals, promos, games, providers, tiers),
 * then passes them as props to the band components — the SC-by-default seam that
 * makes the truthful-only rule structural (the client islands can only render a
 * number the server handed them; an absent surface self-omits, never fabricated).
 *
 * Bands compose in the authored order (SPEC-01 §3.1 / brief):
 *   hero carousel + promo chips → mobile round-icon launcher → auth/identity →
 *   live-games band (jackpot ticker + live-match) → provider tabs + game grid →
 *   sports/esports lifestyle + inline live-odds → footer (with the RG column).
 *   (The VIP luxury aisle and partner/provider band were removed from the home
 *    composition per the J9-fidelity brief — VIP lives on its own route, and the
 *    provider band duplicated the ProviderGameGrid tab strip.)
 *   The desktop RightRail (≥1240) carries
 *   the member-day countdown + super-jackpot + opt-in leaderboard; below 1240 it
 *   is not rendered (those figures fold inline / live in their own bands).
 *
 * Auth-aware: guest vs member differences are resolved inside the client bands
 * via useAuth; gated game-tile launches call openAuthModal (the FTD seam entry).
 * A collapsed dev auth toggle is mounted top-left (dev-only) to QA each state.
