/* ============================================================================
 * Yaobet — MY-CARDS COMPOSITION ROOT.
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The one place adapters are constructed for this route. Everything below this
 * line receives the `CollectionPorts` declaration and nothing else — enforced
 * by lint, which bans adapter imports from components/collection/**.
 *
 * ⛔ THIS ROOT DOES NOT SEED, AND MUST NOT.
 *
 * Store state is persisted per account key in localStorage, so it is SHARED
 * across routes. `CollectionRoot` seeds the demo (`fireActivity` +
 * `mintEarnedOpens`) on mount; if this root seeded too, every
 * /bo-suu-tap → /cua-toi → back round trip would grant free opens and the
 * inventory would quietly disagree with the rails about how the player got
 * there. Seeding is the collection route's job (guarded there, R0.5). This
 * route is a READER: it constructs the adapters against the same account key
 * and reads what is already stored.
 *
 * A player who lands here first therefore sees the honest empty state — which
 * is the correct answer, not a bug: they hold no cards.
 *
 * Swapping fixtures for HTTP adapters is a change to this file alone.
 * ==========================================================================*/
