 * verticalIcon — map a Vertical.iconId (from the lib/mock lobby fixture) to its

 * now matched 1:1 to a dedicated inline-SVG glyph in ui/Icon — one per gaming
 * vertical, matching J9's iconographic category nav: casino chip, slot machine,
 * football, fish, cards, lottery ticket, rooster, game table, lightning (fast
 * games). Defaults to `grid` for any unknown id. Type-safe against IconName.
