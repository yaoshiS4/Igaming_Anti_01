/* ============================================================================
 * AppShell — the build-once chrome wrapper (SPEC-03 B1 / Wave 3.1). A Server
 * Component: it fetches the truthful shell data server-side (verticals, the
 * member balance envelope) and passes them as typed props to the ShellChrome
 * client island — the SC-by-default seam that makes the dynamic-data contract
 * (§F) structural (the client cannot fabricate a number it was never handed).
 *
 * Chrome renders ONCE; the content column (children) swaps without re-rendering
 * the shell (App-Router nested layouts). The desktop RightRail is a slot the
 * host route can fill (home only at v1); Footer + SupportWidget are owned by
 * their own agents (SPEC-04 3.6/3.7) and composed by the root layout below
 * AppShell, or passed via `footer`.
 *
 * Usage (root layout):
 *   <AppShell footer={<Footer/>}>{children}</AppShell>
 * A route that wants the desktop right rail passes it explicitly:
 *   <AppShell rightRail={<RightRail .../>}>{page}</AppShell>
