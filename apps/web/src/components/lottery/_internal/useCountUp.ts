/* ============================================================================
 * useCountUp — a ONE-SHOT tween from 0 to a KNOWN, already-settled figure.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT the ui/Odometer: Odometer is the live-jackpot primitive and
 * is type-gated to a server-bound LiveMoney it must never extrapolate past.
 * This one animates a value that is already final and local (the prize on a
 * card whose outcome was fixed before the first panel was touched), so there is
 * nothing to fabricate — it starts at 0, decelerates INTO the target, stops.
 *
 * `active=false` or reduced-motion → the target, immediately, no tween (the
 * SPEC-03 F5 posture: the truthful figure is shown, the movement is absent).
 * The non-animating answer is DERIVED, not written back through an effect, so
 * there is no cascading-render path at all.
