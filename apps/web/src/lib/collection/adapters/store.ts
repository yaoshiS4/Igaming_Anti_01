/* ============================================================================
 * Yaobet — COLLECTION persistence (GC-103).
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Items, shards, opens, set progress and pity position survive a reload and a
 * browser restart. Without this, everything about this feature is unstorable:
 * the only persistence in the application today is one session-storage key for
 * a dismissal, so a stakeholder who closes the tab loses their collection and
 * the demo reads as a prototype rather than a product.
 *
 * Namespaced per demo account so two seeded accounts can be shown side by side
 * — which is how the suppressed, holdout and blocked paths get demonstrated
 * next to a normal one.
 *
 * SSR-safe: this runs inside an App Router app, so every access is guarded.
 * On the server the store is an in-memory shim and reads return the seed.
 * ==========================================================================*/
