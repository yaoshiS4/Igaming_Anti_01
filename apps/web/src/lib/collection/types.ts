 * Yaobet — COLLECTION feature domain types (PRD "BỘ SƯU TẬP").
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Scope note (GC-101). These are the types the PORTS speak. They are
 * deliberately thin: the card-pool model is an OPEN RULING (BR-03 —
 * sets-own-cards vs sets-are-views) and the universe size `U` is open
 * (BR-04/BR-05). Nothing here may prejudge either. Where a shape depends on
 * those rulings it is marked and kept minimal rather than guessed.
 *
 * PARAMETERS, NEVER LITERALS. `M` (the qualifying amount that mints one open)
 * and `R` (the completion reward) are owner-set and appear nowhere in this
 * codebase as values. They travel as configuration.
 *
 * Reads use the house envelope from "@/lib/types" so the four data states
 * (live / loading / error / absent) are available to every surface for free.
 * ==========================================================================*/

/* ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * 1. ENTITLEMENT — the four-state open
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The lifecycle is fixed by the PRD and is NOT open: an open is minted
 * `pending` at placement, becomes `vested` at settlement, and is `opened`
 * once consumed. `unvested` is the deposit-minted state that the sequence
 * rule governs — money may SCHEDULE an open; only a settled wager may OPEN
 * one (FR-17). An unvested entitlement is never auto-opened by any process;
 * its only terminal alternative to vesting is `lapsed`.
 * --------------------------------------------------------------------------*/

 * 2. THE ACCUMULATOR — the load-bearing shape (GC-101 ⚠)
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The trigger is an OPEN RULING (BR-10/D11). The seam therefore models the
 * ACCUMULATOR, not the qualifying event: "progress toward the next open".
 * Whatever the owner rules — turnover milestone, per-ticket, session,
 * activity-with-stake-as-accelerator — it feeds this same counter, and the UI
 * never learns which. Modelling a bet ticket here instead would leak the
 * unresolved trigger into every surface and is the one expensive mistake in
 * this module.

 * 3. CARDS, SETS, CATALOGUE — minimal, pending BR-03
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * BR-03 decides whether sets OWN cards or are VIEWS over one pool. Until it
 * lands, a card carries its identity and its art, and membership is expressed
 * as a list of set ids the card belongs to — which is representable under
 * BOTH rulings and commits to neither. The rate and craft price deliberately
 * live on the SET-scoped view, not on the card, because a shared card
 * carrying two published rates is precisely the defect BR-03 exists to
 * prevent.
