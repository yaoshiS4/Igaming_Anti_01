/* ============================================================================
 * Yaobet — COLLECTION feature barrel (GC-101).
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * THE ONLY PATH FEATURE CODE IMPORTS FROM.
 *
 * What is exported: the port declarations, the domain types, and the pure
 * arithmetic. What is NOT exported: the adapters. A component that could
 * import a fixture could accidentally ship one, and could learn whether it is
 * talking to a fixture or a backend — which is the one thing this seam exists
 * to prevent.
 *
 * The adapters are wired once, at the composition root (`./provider`), and
 * reach components as the `CollectionPorts` declaration and nothing else.
 *
 * Enforced by lint: no file under components/ or app/ may import
 * `@/lib/collection/adapters/*` or `@/lib/mock` when it is collection code.
 * ==========================================================================*/
