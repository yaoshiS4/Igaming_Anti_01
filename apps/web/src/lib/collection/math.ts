 * Yaobet — COLLECTION arithmetic (GC-107).
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Pure functions. NO React import, no DOM, no clock, no randomness. Every
 * function is verifiable against the economy model in a plain node REPL, which
 * is the point: the economy owner must be able to check the shipped arithmetic
 * without a browser.
 *
 * EVERY economic quantity is an ARGUMENT. Set sizes, universe size, tier
 * masses, shard yields and craft prices are passed in — never literals in this
 * file. `M` and `R` do not appear at all: they are owner parameters and this
 * module never needs them.
 *
 * Open rulings this module deliberately does not resolve:
 *   BR-04/BR-05 — universe size and the rate-derivation source
 *   BR-07       — the recomputed per-set guarantee under catalogue overlap
 *   BR-08       — the pulls-to-finish convention used for catalogue ordering
 *   BR-18       — craft ordering default
 * Where a caller needs one of those, it passes it in and the decision stays
 * visible at the call site instead of being buried here.
