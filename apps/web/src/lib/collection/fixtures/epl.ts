/* ============================================================================
 * Yaobet — COLLECTION demo content: EPL player cards.
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * DEMO CONTENT ONLY. Every number in this file is PROVISIONAL and exists so
 * the loop can be seen working. None of it is the shipped economy:
 *   · the pool model is BR-03,
 *   · the universe size is BR-04,
 *   · the rate-derivation source is BR-05.
 * When those land, this file changes and NOTHING else does — that is the point
 * of the ports seam. Card art, names and club marks are CONTENT, swappable
 * with the theme; there is a licensing gate on real likenesses before
 * production.
 *
 * The three sets are the owner's: 8 same-team, 5 super defenders, 11 super
 * stars — on three overlapping axes, so one card serves several sets.
