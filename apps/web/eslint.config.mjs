   * COLLECTION SEAM (GC-101 / GC-102).
   * --------------------------------------------------------------------------
   * Feature code talks to the ports and nothing else. Two bans:
   *
   *   1. `@/lib/collection/adapters/*` — a component that can import a fixture
   *      can ship one, and can learn whether it is talking to a fixture or a
   *      backend. Adapters are wired once, at the composition root.
   *   2. `@/lib/mock` — the collection feature has its own seam. Reaching past
   *      it into the app-wide fixture layer reintroduces exactly the coupling
   *      the ports exist to remove.
   *
   * The harness page is the single declared exception: its whole job is to
   * construct the adapters and prove the four envelope states render.
   * ========================================================================*/
