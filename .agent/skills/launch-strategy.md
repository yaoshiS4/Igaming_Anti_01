# SKILL: Launch Strategy

**Trigger:** When @pm is preparing to release a new feature, version, or product to users. Triggered by @pm directly or as part of the `/go-to-market` workflow.

---

## When to Use
- New feature launch (any feature significant enough to announce).
- Version release (major or minor with user-facing changes).
- Product launch (first public release / Product Hunt launch).
- Re-launch or pivot announcement.

---

## The Launch Framework: 3 Phases

### Phase 3: Post-Launch (T+1 to T+7)

#### 3.1 Post-Launch Actions
1. **Monitor metrics** (via `growth-metrics` skill):
 - Page views, sign-ups, feature adoption, bounce rate
 - Error rates, performance metrics
2. **Respond to feedback:**
 - User comments, tweets, Product Hunt questions
 - Bug reports → fast-track via @dev
3. **Iterate content:**
 - Update blog post based on user questions
 - Create FAQ if patterns emerge
4. **Capture learnings:**
 - What worked? What didn't? Document in `.hc/retrospectives/`
 - Feed insights back to the next launch

#### 3.2 Post-Launch Metrics Template
```markdown
## Post-Launch Report — [Feature/Version]
**Launch Date:** [YYYY-MM-DD]

### Reach
| Channel | Impressions | Clicks | Engagement Rate |
|---|---|---|---|
| Blog | | | |
| X/Twitter | | | |
| Email | | | |

### Conversion

### Key Learnings
1. [What worked]
2. [What didn't]
3. [What to do differently next time]
```

## Rules
- **Never launch without QC verification.** Feature must pass `verification-before-completion`.
- **Always have a rollback plan.** @devops documents how to revert if launch goes wrong.
- **Launch ≠ Done.** Post-launch monitoring for 7 days is mandatory.
- **Coordinate timing.** Don't launch on Fridays or during holidays (no one is around if things break).

## File Management
- Launch plans → `.hc/launches/`
- Post-launch reports → `.hc/launches/reports/`
