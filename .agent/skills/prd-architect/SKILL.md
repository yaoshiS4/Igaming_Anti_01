# SKILL: PRD ARCHITECT

**Trigger:** When @ba needs to create a new PRD, restructure an existing one, or convert raw ideas into formal requirements.

## When to Use
- Converting brainstorm/chat/bullet-points into structured PRD.
- Starting a new project phase needing formal requirements.
- Running the `/idea-to-prd` workflow.

## Process
1. Gather raw input (idea, brief, user request).
2. If a feature spec exists, use `.agent/templates/feature-spec-template.md` as the structure.
3. Apply the PRD structure template (see `references/prd-template.md`) for PRD output.
4. Mark ALL ambiguities with `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]` — do NOT guess.
5. Validate with Quality Checklist before submitting for review.
6. Verify constitutional compliance (read `.agent/memory/constitution.md`).

## Quality Checklist
- [ ] Every feature has `As a... I want... so that...` user story
- [ ] Every feature has testable Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Features split into MVP (Phase 1) vs Nice-to-have (Phase 2+)
- [ ] No vague requirements — each item specific and measurable
- [ ] No `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION]` markers remain (all resolved via `requirement-interviewer`)
- [ ] Error/edge cases addressed (use `requirement-interviewer` skill)
- [ ] Timeline realistic with clear owners
- [ ] Risk register has ≥ 3 risks
- [ ] Open questions listed with assigned owners
- [ ] Constitution compliance verified (Art. III, V, VII; Art. X-XV for real-money features)
- [ ] (iGaming real-money) Compliance gates listed with server-side enforcement — KYC/age gate, AML, responsible-gaming limits, anti-fraud, audit trail (`guidelines/igaming-compliance.md`)

## Phase Decomposition
- **> 5 Core Features** → split into sub-phases (1a, 1b)
- **Single feature > 8 files** → break into smaller stories
- Always ship smallest useful increment first
- Each phase independently deployable and testable
