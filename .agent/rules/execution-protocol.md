# RULE: EXECUTION PROTOCOL

All agents MUST follow these execution protocols. This file combines verification gates, iteration budgets, coordination rules, and commit discipline.

---

## 1. SOT-Driven Development

All work references **Source of Truth** documents. **Before coding:** read SOT. **After coding:** update SOT if deviated. **If conflict:** SOT wins.

**SOT Documents:** `docs/biz/CONTEXT.md` (root context — read FIRST), `docs/biz/PRD.md`, `docs/tech/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/tech/API_CONTRACTS.md`, `WIREFRAMES.md` (created on-demand).

---

## 2. SPARC Compliance

Follow SPARC phases: Specification → Pseudocode → Architecture → Refinement → Completion.

- Do NOT skip phases (use `/hc-sdlc`). Fast-path (≤3 files, single concern) may skip to Refinement.
- For **Medium+ tasks**, use `amateur-proof-plans` skill during Specification.

### Project-Type Adaptation
Detect project type from config files (`package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `CMakeLists.txt`, etc.) and adapt SPARC gates accordingly:
- **Frontend SPA:** wireframe/story sufficient for S→P; TypeScript interfaces serve as implicit contracts for A→R
- **Backend API:** API contracts required for A→R; security gate mandatory for auth/data flows
- **Full-stack:** both frontend and backend gates apply
- Security Gate: required only for user data, external APIs, or auth flows

### Upstream Gates (P1+ features only)
- **Market Validation:** `.hc/business/research/` must exist with GO/CONDITIONAL GO.
- **Discovery:** `.hc/discovery/` must exist with composite score ≥ 4.0.
- **Exception:** Bug fixes, tech debt, P2 minor features skip upstream gates.

---

## 3. Verification Gate (Tiered)

Match verification tier to task complexity. **Consult `routing.md` Section 1 for the unified task complexity and verification table.**

### Standard Steps (Medium+)
1. Tests pass (`npm test`), lint passes (`npm run lint`), tsc clean (`npx tsc --noEmit`)
2. Visual verification for UI changes (browser screenshot)
3. SOT documents updated. Use `verification-before-completion` skill.

### Cross-Verification Gates
- **Security (Large tasks):** @devops fixes → @whitehat-hacker independently re-tests.
- **UX (ANY UI change):** @dev-fe implements → @user-tester evaluates via `/user-test-session`.
- **Bug Fix:** Bug record in `.hc/bugs/` required → @dev-fe/@dev-be fixes → @qc re-verifies → bug record updated.
- **UAT Done-Gate:** Critical findings block Done. Medium/Minor queued as stories.

---

## 4. Iteration Budget

Every task has a max tool-call budget. **Consult `routing.md` Section 1 for the unified tool budget table.**

**At checkpoint (75% of budget):** Summarize progress, assess remaining work vs budget. If >50% work remains with <25% budget → trigger Context Reset (`context-budget.md` Section 4).

**Exceeding max:** STOP and escalate to @pm (or User if @pm is stuck).

---

## 5. Agent Communication

Inter-agent communication uses structured format:
```
**FROM:** @agent | **TO:** @agent | **RE:** [Subject]
**CONTENT:** [Message] | **ACTION NEEDED:** [Yes/No — what]
```

Team-mode (party/swarm): Use `🎯 **@pm:**` emoji-prefixed format. Max 3 discussion rounds before synthesis.

---

## 6. Parallel Resource Limits

- Max **2 parallel agent threads** (hard limit per wave) for Gemini CLI agents. Other CLIs (Claude, Codex) may use up to 4 if their rate limits permit.
- **Sequential Wave Batching:** If a task requires >2 tracks, SPLIT into waves of 2.
  - Run Wave 1 (2 workers) -> Wait for completion -> **30s cool-down** -> Run Wave 2.
  - Summarize Results after each wave -> Flush Context.
- Queue additional work if capacity reached.

---

## 7. Auto-Fallback & Recovery

When an agent is stuck: **Detect** (3x expected time or anti-loop trigger) → **Kill** → **Reset** (re-read task from SOT) → **Replace** (fundamentally different approach) → escalate to User if still failing.

---

## 8. Sub-Agent Spawn Limits

- **Max spawn depth:** 2 levels (orchestrator → agent → sub-task).
- **Max total active agents per task:** 3 (1 orchestrator + 2 workers).
- **Max sequential delegations without execution:** 3 → HALT.

### CLI Worker Rules (Gemini CLI via spawn-agent)
- CLI workers count toward all limits above. Each process = one agent.
- Workers MUST NOT spawn sub-agents. They are terminal nodes.
- **Context injection:** Use role-scoped LITE files: `AGENTS-LITE-dev.md`, `AGENTS-LITE-qc.md`, `AGENTS-LITE-pm.md`, `AGENTS-LITE-designer.md`, `AGENTS-LITE-sa.md`, `AGENTS-LITE-devops.md`, or generic `AGENTS-LITE.md`. **Never** full `AGENTS.md`.
- **Skill lazy-loading mandatory:** Read MANIFEST → view_file only needed skills.
- **Output review mandatory:** Read output logs AND run `git diff`. Never assume success.
- **One task per spawn.** Review output between spawns.
- **Failed worker = orchestrator takes over.** Fix prompt or complete inline.

---

## 9. Coordination Model

**Consult `routing.md` Section 1** to determine the appropriate Delegation Mode based on the task classification.

> **Analysis/review tasks** touching zero files but requiring 3+ perspectives are effectively Large+. Route through Mandatory Spawn Gate.

---

## 10. Commit Discipline

- **Atomic commits:** One logical change per commit.
- **Conventional format:** `type(scope): description`.
- **Types:** `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `test`, `docs`, `chore`, `style`, `perf`.
- **Never commit:** Broken tests, lint errors, `console.log` debugging, secrets.

---

## 11. Verify + Done Pattern (Mandatory for All Task Prompts)

Every phase file, spawn-agent task, or inline execution plan MUST include these two sections:

### `## Verify`

Exact command(s) or checks that confirm the task succeeded. Must be runnable, not aspirational.

**Good:** `curl -X POST localhost:3000/api/auth/login -d '{"email":"test@test.com"}' returns 200 + Set-Cookie header`
**Bad:** "Verify that login works correctly"

### `## Done When`

Unambiguous boolean checklist. Every item must be independently verifiable as true/false.

**Good:**
- [ ] `npm test` passes with 0 failures
- [ ] New endpoint returns 401 for invalid credentials
- [ ] Migration creates `users` table with `email` unique constraint

**Bad:**
- [ ] Everything works
- [ ] Code is clean

### Enforcement

- **Phase files** (`.hc/phases/`): MUST have both sections before execution begins.
- **Spawn-agent prompts** (`.agent/spawn_agent_tasks/`): MUST have at minimum a `## Done When` section.
- **Quick inline tasks:** At minimum, one-line verify statement in the prompt.
- **If missing:** @pm adds them before routing to execution. DO NOT execute without exit conditions.
