description: Git Hygiene - conventional commits, atomic changes, and branch naming

# RULE: GIT HYGIENE

**Mode:** Always On
**Scope:** @dev-fe, @dev-be, @devops

---

## Commit Message Format (Conventional Commits)
```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body]
[optional footer]
```

### Types
| Type | When |
|---|---|
| `feat` | New feature |
| `fix` | Bug fix |
| `refactor` | Code restructuring (no behavior change) |
| `perf` | Performance improvement |
| `test` | Adding/updating tests |
| `docs` | Documentation changes |
| `style` | Formatting, whitespace (no logic change) |
| `chore` | Build, tooling, dependencies |
| `ci` | CI/CD configuration |

### Examples
```
feat(feature): add category placement in dashboard grid
fix(wallet): correct balance rounding on bet settlement
refactor(engines): extract common star mapping logic
perf(chart): memoize data interpretation lookup
test(odds): add BVA tests for odds boundary values
```

## Atomic Commits
- One logical change per commit.
- Don't mix features with fixes in the same commit.
- Don't mix formatting with logic changes.

## Branch Naming
```
<type>/<short-description>
```
Examples: `feat/feature-temporal-overlay`, `fix/date-boundary-handling`, `refactor/engine-types`

## Rules
- Never commit directly to `main`.
- Never use "WIP", "update", or "fix" as entire commit messages.
- Every commit should leave the codebase in a working state.
- Squash fixup commits before merging to main.

## Commit Frequency (MANDATORY)

> [!CAUTION]
> **Zero-commit conversations that touch source files are a red flag.** Every conversation that modifies code MUST produce at least one commit.

**Checkpoint Rule:**
- **Commit after each completed sub-task** — not just at the end of the conversation.
- **3-file trigger:** If the agent has made changes to 3+ files without committing → commit now before proceeding to the next sub-task.
- **Pre-context-switch commit:** Before switching to a different domain or component within the same conversation → commit the current work first.

**Red Flags:**
| Signal | Severity | Action |
|---|---|---|
| Conversation touched source files but produced 0 commits | 🔴 Process violation | Agent must explain why in task summary |
| 5+ file edits without a commit | 🟡 Elevated risk | Commit immediately, even if work is partial (use `wip(scope):` prefix) |
| Multiple conversations on same component without commits between them | 🔴 Fragmentation | Consolidate and commit |

**Exception:** Pure research/analysis conversations that only read files (no edits) are exempt.
